# 🐾 AI Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

A simple and interactive web application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow that classifies uploaded images as a cat, a dog, or something else. This project uses the powerful, pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to perform real-time image recognition.

* **Detailed Predictions**: Shows the top 3 specific predictions from the MobileNetV2 model (e.g., "Siamese Cat", "Golden Retriever") along with their confidence scores.
* **Fast and Efficient**: Leverages a pre-trained model and Streamlit's caching for a smooth user experience.
* **Responsive UI**: The web interface is clean and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
